I.implement "captcha" validation codes:(and the files are mentioned below are all can be found in the directories)
1.put the whole directory "kcaptcha" into "vendors";
2.create a customized component named "CaptchaComponent":create a file named "captcha.php" into directory "controllers/components/"
3.add two functions to the controller, one is "captcha()", and the other is "__checkCaptcha()".
4.show the validation codes in views, you can see them in "views/trans/login.ctp", line 32 to 49.
5.and then we could validate it with some logic in action "login" of the controller.

II.Extends the PaginatorHelper
1.extends the PaginatorHelper:the corresponding file is in "views/helpers/" and named "ex_paginator.php" according to the "Camel rules".
2.include the ExPaginator in your controller, such as "var $helpers = array('', ..., '', 'ExPaginator');"
3.back to the views and replace all the helpers "$paginator" to "$exPaginator".
4.the "ExPaginator" add a "class" option to the link it creates, so we should define the class "asc"/"desc" in our css file.
5.then put a image file present "asc" and a image file present "desc" into our directory "webroot/img".
6.and that's it.
